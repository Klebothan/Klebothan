INTRODUCTION
Hello world! I'm Klebothan (usually go by Kleb)
I am 16 years old and looking to increase my knowledge on programming and game development.
WHY I WANT TO LEARN GAME DEVELOPMENT
I have enjoyed playing video games for quite a long time now and I'm really interested in learning how they're made and even making some myself!
CONTACT
